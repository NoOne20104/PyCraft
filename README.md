# PyCraft

PyCraft is a 2D sandbox game written in Python using Pygame.  
It is built as a learning-focused sandbox and engine-style project, featuring
procedural world generation, smooth camera movement, and multiple in-game
systems such as commands, inventory management, and a day/night cycle.

The game also includes a mini in-game terminal inspired by Linux-style command
interfaces.
